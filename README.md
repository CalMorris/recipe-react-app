# Full stack application for recipes

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

>npm run dev

open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.



### This application was built to practice and learn:
* React
* Redux
* RESTful API's
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Chakra (ui framework)
* knex.js
* Jest
* Supertest

The External recipe API uses spoonacular to find recipes using keywords and recipe id's. To use this application, please sign up to spoonacular and generate an API key.
The api key will replace the code named `process.env.API_KEY` in the server side routes.

Future plans / wish list:
* Add a responsive design (mobile first)
* Add more testing on the front end
