# Full stack application for recipes

This project uses the spoonacular api to find recipes using keywords and recipe id's. To use this app, please sign up to spoonacular and generate an API key.
The api key will replace the code named `process.env.API_KEY` server side routes.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

>npm run dev

open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
